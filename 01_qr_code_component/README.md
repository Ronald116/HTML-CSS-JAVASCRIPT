## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

1. Flexbox for Centering Elements
Using Flexbox to center elements both horizontally and vertically was crucial in creating a responsive design. Flexbox simplifies alignment tasks that were traditionally challenging with older CSS techniques.

Code snippets:
```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    border: solid 1px white;
    height: 550px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 15px;
    width: 350px;
    padding: 0px;

}
```

### Continued development

1. Advanced CSS Grid Layouts
While Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts, CSS Grid excels at creating complex two-dimensional layouts. I want to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid to create more intricate and responsive designs.

Focus Areas:

Grid template areas
Auto-placement algorithm
Creating nested grids


Areas for Future Focus
While working through this project, I identified several areas that I want to continue focusing on and refining in future projects. These include both concepts I'm still mastering and techniques that I found particularly useful and aim to perfect.

1. Advanced CSS Grid Layouts
While Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts, CSS Grid excels at creating complex two-dimensional layouts. I want to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid to create more intricate and responsive designs.

Focus Areas:

Grid template areas
Auto-placement algorithm
Creating nested grids
Example: Basic Grid Layout

2. JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries
Leveraging JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular can significantly enhance front-end development efficiency and scalability. I plan to deepen my understanding and proficiency with these tools.

Focus Areas:

Component-based architecture
State management
Integration with backend services
